        "**The Decision Tree (CART) Algorithm** \n",
        "\n",
        "A decision tree is a decision support tool that models possible outcomes based on a number of conditions (Singh & Gupta 2014). Starting with a root node, an algorithm is applied that splits into additional nodes recursively resulting in a workflow that predicts an outcome (Peng, Chen & Zhou 2009). Common decision tree algorithms include Iterative Dichotomiser (ID3) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) which use different splitting criteria to determine a score that identifies the best way to split a dataset (Singh & Gupta 2014).\n",
        "\n",
        "For this project, the CART algorithm was implemented from scratch using Python 3. The representation of the CART model is a binary tree where each node can have zero, one or two child nodes (Brownlee 2016). All input variables and all possible split points are evaluated and chosen in a greedy manner based on the Gini impurity function. The Gini impurity provides a purity score representing the miss-classification rate within a dataset. A split is made on the best score at each level of depth. Splitting continues until a stopping condition is reached such as nodes contain a minimum number of training examples or a maximum tree depth is reached. Once created, a tree can be navigated by following the rules at each branch until a final prediction is reached.\n",
        "\n",
        "CART has the following advantages and disadvantages (Timofeev 2004) & (Singh & Gupta 2014):\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages:\n",
        "* CART can handle both numerical and categorical variables.\n",
        "* CART algorithm will identify the most significant variables.\n",
        "* CART can handle outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Disadvantages:\n",
        "* CART may have unstable decision tree. Minor modification such as changes in splitting variables and values can greatly increase or decrease tree complexity. \n",
        "* CART can only split by one variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Define Input/Output** \n",
        "\n",
        "This algorithm was designed to handle any dataset that includes features and target columns with numeric values. The target column needs to contain only one value (i.e. not a multivariable entry). For this reason, we have imported the sklearn dataset library to provide the user input to experiment with that meet these requirements.  Note, that the dataset is turned into a Panda dataframe. Pandas is a Python library providing integrated, intuitive routines for performing common data manipulations and analysis on data sets (McKinney 2011). The provided code will convert the sklearn database into a pandas dataframe and build a decision tree based on the maxdepth inputted by the users. After running the algorithm, the decision tree and the predicted value of each tested instance will be printed in the command line.\n"

        "\n",
        "**Practical Significance**\n",
        "\n",
        "Decision trees are practically significant as they are intuitively understood by laypeople such as stakeholders. This makes it a useful tool for explanation purposes. They also form a foundational part of understanding machine learning. \n",
        "\n",
        "The implementation of the CART decision tree algorithm is a practically significant project because it represents the value of decision tree learning. These include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   Demonstrating the generalization of unobserved instances (when described in terms of features that are correlated with a target class).\n",
        "2. Demonstrating that the computation efficiency is proportional to the number of observed training instances (the size of the dataset).\n",
        "3.   Demonstrating that a decision tree model as an intuitive classification process that is relatively easy to understand (e.g. doctors use it when diagnosing patients).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Challenges**\n",
        "\n",
        "The following challenges were encountered when designing our decision tree, and implementing the solution:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Dataset Selection\n",
        "\n",
        "A challenge faced was having an appropriate dataset to use for training the CART decision tree. This was solved by using sklearn database datasets that meet the requirements for implementing the algorithm. As is expected, this project cannot handle multivariable data as this is a known limitation of CART.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Finding the best split\n",
        "\n",
        "Originally the net sum of the gini impurity at each split point was calculated by summing the gini impurity of both the left and right side of each possible split. We found that although it performed well for some splits,  it would start to favour ‘edge’ cases; i.e. choosing a split close to an end point since that would give the best ‘net’ impurity. This was solved by implementing a weighted net gini impurity. This was calculated based on the proportion of data points remaining in each split point/leaf. This weighted calculation gave less importance to edge cases and improved the quality of splitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Training Storage\n",
        "\n",
        "Another challenge faced was how to ‘store’ the structure of the decision tree. It was easy to identify how to do each split and draw the tree manually, however, putting that information into Python proved difficult. \n",
        "\n",
        "The first approach was a ‘test’ row would be stored, and then tested simultaneously as the tree was created. This would have been disastrous for performance, however, since every entry would have a new tree created. \n",
        "\n",
        "We solved this by storing the tree model into a Python dictionary, storing every possible node value. For example at depth 1, we created a dictionary containing 2 sets of nodes with all possible outcomes. For depth 2, we created 4, and for depth 3 we’d create 8. This proved effective as we are able to see a ‘complete’ and symmetrical tree,  however it is also exponentially taxing, computationally as the depth increases.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Predicting & Pruning\n",
        "\n",
        "Knowing when the decision tree should ‘commit’ to a prediction was a challenge. It was decided that the algorithm should make a ‘decision’ if there was only one target value remaining for a particular leaf. For example, with the Iris data set, splitting at Petal Length <= 1.9, resulted in only 0 or ‘Setosa’ Irises left. Further improving this, a decision was set to be made when the max depth parameter was met. Note that if more than one target value remained on a leaf node the target value with the highest mode, and if the mode was equal, the first entry would be selected as the decision. \n",
        "\n",
        "This might still lead to challenges if depth is increased too much, causing overfitting to become more prominent since it may split when only one target data point remains. \n",
        "Pruning also provided a challenge as there is no way to check when to stop pruning. The algorithm required manual observation to determine the best depth to ‘prune’ the tree. This project kept to a ‘max depth’ method that requires ‘trial and error’ in order to check each depth for meaningful predictions.. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Design Data Structures**\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, a learning problem considers a set of n samples of data and then tries to predict properties of unknown data. When planning the algorithm implementation we started with the maths that defined how to calculate the best split points (Hastie et al 2008, at p 308). \n",
        "\n",
        "It was decided to use the gini impurity to determine impurity since we had a classification (as opposed to a regression) problem, and gini impurity was the more appropriate measure of impurity as it was differentiable, sensitive to change and was intuitively understood (Hastie et al 2008, at p 310). \n",
        "\n",
        "We also decided to do binary splits rather than multiway splits as we didn’t want to split the data too quickly, especially since datasets like the Iris set did not have a huge amount of data to split. \n",
        "\n",
        "When determining the decision node, we decided that unique value as a deciding factor mixed with a maximum depth would be appropriate, especially upon a visual inspection of the Iris data set. Other options such as a minimum impurity level or working out smoothness or linear combination splits seemed unnecessarily complex for our given data. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* data acquisition\n",
        "\n",
        "The Scikit-learn library provides datasets, for example the iris and wine datasets for classification and the boston house prices dataset for regression (Louppe 2016). Each dataset is a Python dictionary-like object that holds all the data and some metadata about the data. This data is stored in the data member, which is a n_samples and n_features array.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the case of supervised problem, one or more response variables are stored in the target member. This is the number corresponding classification that we are trying to learn.\n",
        "For each dataset, the.data member gives access to the features that can be used to classify the digits\n",
        "\n",
        "* quality control\n",
        "\n",
        "Quality control refers to the state of completeness, conformity, consistency, timeliness, duplication, integrity, and accuracy that makes data appropriate for a specific use (Strong, Lee. & Wang 1997). For the purpose of simplification, the sklearn database library has been used as a way to manage the data quality of each dataset. Each dataset  is provided in identical format, which has allowed the focus of the project to be on the algorithm implementation and streamline a common standard of data input.\n",
        "\n",
        "* modelling techniques\n",
        "\n",
        "The decision tree was modeled into a series of python dictionaries, which represented nodes of a tree. Each dictionary holds relevant information of the depth, decision, feature, value and right/left value for each node. Each level of depth was used as a reference and further rules applied if ‘decision’ was none. The right left value is used to determine if the value is greater than or less than.\n",

        "The implementation of the CART decision tree algorithm has demonstrated how to generalize classification of instances based on features being correlated to a target class. In statistics, overfitting is the production of an analysis that corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data, and may therefore fail to predict future observations reliably (Tetko et all 1995). The problem of overfitting is identified and proposed to be managed through or generalization (Friedman 1999). \n",

        "This project allows a user to experiment with the tree depth and how it affects the accuracy of a prediction.This highlights the effect of depth control as a requires management in order to avoid overfitting and maintain generalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "The computation efficiency has also been demonstrated showing that cpu run time  is proportional to the number of instances, features and depth. This project implementation may not be the most efficient method but it highlights the impact of datasets with different number of rows and features. This can be further explored with the maxdepth parameter and observe its effect. In our learnings we discovered using a class instead of a dictionary would improve computational efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* Propose Possible Improvements\n",
        "\n",
        "A number of possible improvements have been identified that if implemented would improve the performance and efficiency of the code. Firstly, if we defined a ‘node’ class instead of using dictionaries the performance would increase exponentially due to the fact that we store all previous dictionary entries into each subsequent dictionary depth. \n",
        "\n",
        "Another improvement would be implementing other splitting criteria (e.g. entropy & information gain) so that comparisons can be made between their performance. If additional user parameters were included that improved experimentation, such as pruning or setting a gini impurity threshold greater generalization could be achieved. \n",
        "\n",
        "Further methods could also be implemented to work out the optimal depth of the tree than manually determining it, such as doing a grid search. \n",
        "\n",
        "If the algorithm is implemented on different data sets, which are not as balanced as the Iris dataset, further improvements could be made by weighing the minority class more heavily.\n",
        "Also, this CART decision tree implementation could be expanded into a random forest algorithm (or gradient boosted tree) by iterating a number of tree builds and picking the best scores for a better chance at building a more accurate model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the test data was taken as a subset of the training data. Ideally, these should be independent of each other. For demonstration purposes we did not split, and as such the results are over-fitted, but nonetheless currently shows a demonstration of the algorithm working. \n",

The CART decision tree implementation project adopts the utilitarianism model, which aims to do what causes the most good for the most people (Anderson & Anderson 2011). This approach is designed into the algorithm by making decisions based on the best possible split point and aims to guide the user on the potential classification of an instance based on historically observed features.\n",

If the predicted target value was to be treated as evidence for future decisions it has the potential to be misguided due to the probabilistic nature of how a prediction is made (Willis 2014). This can be especially pronounced when used by users less well versed with the algorithm, such as with higher management or stakeholders. Such users will easily comprehend how the decision tree works, but may apply hard and fast rules to something which should have such rules.\n",

        "The algorithm can also lead to socially unacceptable generalisations and biasedness, such as making decisions based on race, sex or religion. This can cause certain features to be prejudicial when making decisions. This can cause further dilemmas such as whether a data scientist should use such discriminatory features when classifying data (e.g. is it ethical that race be a feature in determining fraud?). \n",
        "\n",
        "Ultimately, decisions may be being made without considering unobserved features that would contribute greatly to future classifications. For example, it might not be race being the determinative of crime rates, but socio-economic backgrounds. With the algorithm, the generalisations of features may not be adequately showing this."
