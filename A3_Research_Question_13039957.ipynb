        "## Background research\n",
        "\n",
        "Influencing social media is now a well researched area and many approaches are applied in real-world situations (Neethu & Rajasree 2013). Many businesses implement social media campaigns as part of their marketing strategy to leverage positive sentiment for their benefit (Melville, Sindhwani & Lawrence 2009). Cambridge Analytica is an analytics company that claims to have used social networking websites to tailor messages to individual's psychological traits and gain support in a political campaign (Ward 2018). Methods drawn from behavioural theory, persuasion psychology, and marketing science with regard to health behaviour, human reactions to messages and message delivery are applied to social networking messages to influence health behaviour (Evans 2006). It has been found that messages are more effective when they are custom-made to reflect an individual's interests and concerns (Hirsh, Kang & Bodenhausen 2012).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Existing approaches\n",
        "\n",
        "Many solutions have been proposed related to how to best analyse and influence users of  social media (Stieglitz et al 2014). A common approach to social media analytics is to use sentiment analysis to design messages that would most likely convert a person’s support  (Fan & Gordon 2014).  Two common strategies for sentiment analysis is the knowledge base approach or machine learning approach (Neethu & Rajasree 2013).\n",
        "\n",
        "The knowledge base approach identifies sentiment through a dataset of predefined classifications that determines how sentiment is grouped (Cambria 2013). In general, this requires that a dictionary of words and their classification be manually constructed or found from an outside source (Alessia et al 2015). The advantage to this is that you have control of the classifications and definitions of each word. The disadvantage to this is that it is a manual process limited by a finite number of words with a fixed sentiment classification assigned to each word.\n",
        "\n",
        "The machine learning approach makes use of a training set to build a sentiment classifier (Kotsiantis, Zaharakis & Pintelas 2007). It uses supervised machine learning tools such as Bayesian networks, Naive Bayes classification, maximum entropy, neural networks and support vector machine to classify words (Alessia et al 2015). The advantage to this is the ability to adapt and create trained models for specific purposes and contexts. The disadvantage is that it has limited practicality as it still requires sourcing or generating a labeled training dataset."

        "Several challenges present themselves when solving this problem. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Defining your goal\n",
        "\n",
        "Defining your goal means answering the question ‘what is your success criteria?’ (Westerveld 2003). It is entirely possible that multiple domains need to be treated separately to account for their differences (Neethu & Rajasree 2013). This includes different social media platforms, geographical locals, special interest groups and more. Some examples of success criteria could be in terms of response sentiment (e.g. likes, positive messages, actions, shares, etc) or in terms of a quantifiable result (e.g. election result, sales made, site traffic, etc). TKnowing you have successfully influences someone’s support is a challenge because you have to have something relevant and observable that can confirm whether or not influence has been successful or not (Neethu & Rajasree 2013).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data gathering\n",
        "\n",
        "An increasing number of social media platforms has created a challenge in data collection where a large amount of social media messages are generated from many sources and in different formats (Katal, Wazid & Goudar 2013). There are limitations such as only having access to public messages where potential bias could be introduced (Lin, Bagrow & Lazer 2011). Additionally, with each additional social media service, an application program interface (API) key will need to be purchased at a cost to the project. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Natural language processing\n",
        "\n",
        "When analysing the text of each message it is possible to detect the presence of opinion-bearing words and associate them to a feature that can produce a prediction  (Cambria et al 2013). This becomes increasing difficult due to issues with natural language processes, for example text containing slang words and spellings mistakes (Neethu & Rajasree 2013). In addition, being able to infer the cognitive and affective information associated with natural language, does not account for the context of responses to certain questions and conversations (Cambria et al 2013). Social media text analysis is arguably ineffective because a single sentence (sometimes limited to a set number of characters) can be misinterpreted in so many ways due to human nature (Cambria et al 2013).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Sentiment analysis classification \n",
        "\n",
        "Supervised approaches rely on manually labeled samples, however, sentiment isn't limited to a single classification (Neethu & Rajasree 2013). In addition, not all portions of text contain an indication of sentiment. The challenge here is to identify what particular words for a particular domain are most effective at influencing people support. Similar to the natural language processing challenge things like sarcasm and irony will not be detected while classifying. A number of sentiment analysis dictionaries are available pre-built, however, can be considered too general to apply to all cases (Alessia et al 2015). Finding the best approach becomes difficult and generalization can negatively affect a models output from one domain to the other (Joshi & Penstein-Rosé 2009)."

        "## Proposed solution\n",
        "\n",
        "The proposed solution to this problem is a hybrid of the knowledge base and machine learning approach that will input a message and output a predict sentiment score. Using social media API’s, a sentence level sentiment analysis is performed. This is done by manually building a knowledge base, preprocessing each message, extracting features and assigning a class (such as positive or negative) to each word. In addition to assigning a class, a weight is assigned to emphasis features to add more or less value a sentiment score.  From the total weighted number of messages in each class, the overall sentiment for a domain can be determined. It is important to note that the more granular the sentiment classes the more information about sentiment can be found (i.e. including a ‘neutral’ or ‘irrelevant’ class may help better determine sentiment). A sentiment classification is performed with several machine learning methods scoring words and emphasis words. Finally, a message can be inputted and checked against the predicted sentiment based on the features contained in the message. These messages can then be refined to gain the highest possible predicted sentiment score.\n"

        "Many different classifiers can be used  for text classification. These techniques can be applied in the same way  for social media message sentiment classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Naive Bayes Classifier\n",
        "The Naive Bayes classifier uses all the features and analyzes them as independent of each other (i.e. Naive Bayes does not consider the relationships between features).The conditional probability for Naive Bayes can be defined as:\n",
        "\n",

        "$g(X)=wTϕ(X)+b$\n",

A linear kernel is used for classification. It maintains a wide gap between two classes.\n",

The classifier will classify based on the output of majority of classifiers.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Other solutions\n",
        "\n",
        "Other potential solutions could be to treat the task as a simple classification of whether or not a tweet will be shared based on features provided in the social media API (Hong, Dan & Davison 2011). This approach is limited as it would consider features outside the construction of a message such as time sent, number of followers, images, etc. While these may be relevant to influencing people it is outside of scope for the goal of construction the best message. The proposed approach accounts for this by only considering the features within the message as features of what makes the most influential message.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another solution would be to implement behavioral microtargeting (Cadwalladr & Graham-Harrison 2018). This approach was used by Cambridge Analytica by gathering a massive social media dataset, building profiles (classifications), assigning individuals to each profile and designing personalised messages to those profiles (Ward 2018). Behavioural microtargeting aims to determine what message would be most effective to influence an individual based on a pre-determined psychological profiles that contain personal attributes and preferences (Cadwalladr & Graham-Harrison 2018). The limitation of this approach is that it has some ethical issues that could be considered inappropriate. The proposed approach accounts for this by grouping individuals by predefined domains such as social media platform or a preexisting group created on these platforms.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Neethu & Rajasree (2013) proposed a feature vector method for classifying twitter messages as positive or negative while extracting an opinion about a topic. This approach extracts text from twitter posts and uses special keywords, negation, emoticons, number of positive keywords, number of negative keywords, number of positive hashtags and number of negative hashtags as features to determine the sentiment of each tweet (Neethu & Rajasree 2013). This approach is similar to the proposed approach, however, limited by detecting only the overall sentiment of twitter messages rather than predicting the sentiment of an input message. \n"

If the predicted classification is treated as evidence for future decisions it has the potential to be misguided due to the probabilistic nature of how a prediction is made (Willis 2014). This problem grows when the subject matter experts inject bias while building the knowledge base. Ultimately, this approach provides a tool that can highlight a set of words and that can be associated to a subject matter experts view of a sentiment classification (e.g. positive or negative).\n",
        "\n",
        "It is also possible that socially unacceptable generalisations and bias is introduced. This includes making decisions in a domain based on race, sex or religion. This can cause certain features to be prejudicial when classifying. This creates the ethical problem of whether or not to consider potentially discriminatory features when classifying sentiment. \n",

        "Ultimately, sentiment analysis is quite simplistic. When considering the highly complex nature of human communication, it seems inappropriate to break it down into a set of words associated with a classification.
